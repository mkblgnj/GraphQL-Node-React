# React Application -  GraphQL & Node

An Application built using React that fetches the books and its Author. Also we can add more books. We have used Nodejs as Backend, MongoDB for storing data and GraphQL for querying and mutation in the Database from client side.

## Demo
You can check the Applicatio here:

### React Application(Client Side):
